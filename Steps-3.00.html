This involved tasks such as handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and removing duplicates. Additionally, I implemented error handling mechanisms to capture and log data quality issues in an error log. Subsequently, I designed a separate Data Flow within a Sequence Container to rescrub the erroneous data identified in the error log, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1415/3/9.jpg"><br></p><p> <br><b>2.Importing and Transforming in Power Query Editor:</b> When dealing with data import and transformation in Power Query Editor, I leveraged its intuitive interface to import data from various sources and perform data transformations. This included tasks like merging datasets, filtering rows, creating calculated columns, and pivoting data to achieve the desired data structure. Power Query Editor's graphical interface allowed for a streamlined approach to data shaping and preparation, ultimately enhancing the data's suitability for analysis.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1415/3/10.jpg"><br></p><p><br></p><p> <br><b>3.Handling Missing Revenue and Report Filtering in Power BI:</b>  In Power BI, I addressed the issue of missing revenue data in certain years by implementing data modeling techniques that didn't rely on COALESCE or IF functions. Instead, I leveraged Power BI's capabilities to work with missing data, such as using the 'Show items with no data' option in visualizations, and by creating calculated columns or measures that could infer missing revenue based on available data and relationships with other dimensions. Additionally, I utilized Power BI's built-in filtering and page navigation features to enable users to explore the reports effectively, ensuring a seamless user experience even when dealing with incomplete revenue data.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1415/3/8.jpg" style="width: 100%;"><br></p><p></p>
