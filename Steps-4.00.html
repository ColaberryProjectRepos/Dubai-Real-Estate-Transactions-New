Notably, in most years, rental income showed robust growth. For instance, in 2021, rental prices increased by <font color="#397b21">4.30%</font>, and in 2019, they grew by <font color="#397b21">1.13%</font>. This trend suggests several factors at play, including sustained demand for rental properties, which can be inferred from the consistent year-over-year growth in rent prices. Additionally, it's possible that inflation played a role in driving up rental prices, as higher living costs can lead to increased rental rates. Moreover, the data may reflect improvements in the quality of rental units or amenities over time, which could justify higher rental prices. These positive trends in rent prices indicate a potentially profitable aspect of the business, which can contribute positively to the overall revenue and financial health of the organization.<br></p>
