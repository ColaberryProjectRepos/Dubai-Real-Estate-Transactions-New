1
<p>In Dubai, the financial data for 2023 reveals a significant concern with revenue (Rev YoY%) plummeting by<font color="#397b21"> 69.02%</font> compared to the previous year. This decline aligns with a long-term trend of decreasing revenue, as evidenced by a <font color="#ff0000" style="">60.41%</font> year-over-year decrease since 2013. Although there was a temporary surge in 2021 with a <font color="#397b21">67.32%</font> increase in revenue, this improvement was not sustained. Furthermore, 2020 saw a<font color="#ff0000"> 30.87%</font> decline in revenue. Despite a positive development in rental income (Rent YoY%) in 2023, it may not be sufficient to counterbalance the overall decline in revenue, necessitating immediate attention and strategic interventions to address this critical financial issue.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1415/1/1.jpg"></p>
